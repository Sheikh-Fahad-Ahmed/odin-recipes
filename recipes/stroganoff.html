    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        For this chicken stroganoff recipe, I wanted something like the traditional beef stroganoff and threw this one
        together, writing down everything as I went so I wouldn't forget. I served it with noodles, but rice would be
        great too. For a complete meal, make asparagus for a vegetable side and a green or fruit salad. Nutmeg seems to
        be the secret ingredient of many stroganoff recipes.
