    <p>
        No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly
        toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full
        flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.
